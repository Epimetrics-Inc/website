## Description

Ever wondered what epidemics were like in the past? If you are interested in learning how health emergencies may be addressed and managed, this podcast is for you. 

Novel diseases have the ability to inspire fear, dissent, and conflict around the world. Through travelling back to past epidemics, we may understand how to better address and manage COVID-19 today. Tune into Epi(riod) in time as we revisit how epidemiologists John Snow, Thomas Francis Jr., and Nicole Grasset helped control outbreaks of Cholera, Influenza A and B, and Smallpox, respectively. 

No matter where this podcast may be published, credit will be attributed to the authors.
