EpiMetrics, Inc. is a health research institution geared towards the achievement of health equity through rigorous and creative conception, execution, translation, and communication of health systems and policy research.

Since our conception in 2015, we have delivered a diverse portfolio of intelligence, insight, and analysis spanning the six building blocks of the health systems. We have provided national decision makers the evidence and information they need to make sound decisions and policy.

We are also paving new roads for the next generation of researchers who will develop the Philippine health system for decades to come.
