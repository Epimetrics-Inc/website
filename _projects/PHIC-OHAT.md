description: |
  To ensure good quality care and improved service delivery in the country, health facilities are monitored by the Department of Health (DOH). In compliance with these health facilities’ annual licensing, DOH requires submission of Hospital Statistical Reports (HSRs), which are reports on quality management, hospital operations, staffing patterns, and finances. This study assessed the online Hospital Statistical Reports (OHSR) in terms of health information resources, indicators, data management, and information products. 

  The study revealed that there is a need for quality improvement efforts in data collection and validation of the OHSRs. Quality of data from OHSRs were compromised because of problems in both the hospital side and the regulator side. First, there were variations in hospital processes – such as how work was being done, who does the work, and the type of indicators used. Second, there were policy gaps from the regulator – such as the lack of a feedback mechanism and unclear implementing rules and regulations. Poor quality data from OHSRs resulted in the limitations of the study in terms of generalizability and accuracy. Because informed policy making rests on the analysis of quality data, the study recommends that quality improvement efforts of the OHSR process be undertaken. These will provide sufficient data for the monitoring of health facilities and allow regulators to ensure good quality care and improve service delivery.

The PhilHealth Outpatient HIV/AIDS Treatment (OHAT) package was created to improve financial risk protection, access to services, and, eventually, health outcomes for people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the Philippines. This review was done to assess the current PhilHealth OHAT package of PhilHealth in terms of effectiveness, economics, and equity. Under effectiveness, OHAT package benefit utilization, quality of care improvement, and health outcome contribution are measured. Under economics, contribution to financial risk protection is assessed and the cost of the OHAT benefit package delivery, in the perspective of service providers, is measured. Under equity, health service coverage, accessibility of services, and accessibility of different patient groups are measured. 

Through this review, it was found that many PLHIV, particularly among vulnerable groups benefit from the package in terms of access to services and medications, as well as in reducing out-of-pocket expenditure. In terms of effectiveness and economics, the current case rate is effective in covering for first line of treatment and for the primary need for laboratory tests. However, more support is needed as the range of out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure varies for patients. In terms of equity, access to support from PhilHealth has been limited. This merits the need to acknowledge a wider range of conditions and to further characterize groups who are likely to utilize OHAT to help refine and improve the package. To achieve these, DOH and PhilHealth will have to jointly decide how to manage and rationalize funding streams as well as to explore the potential role of the private sector as providers.
