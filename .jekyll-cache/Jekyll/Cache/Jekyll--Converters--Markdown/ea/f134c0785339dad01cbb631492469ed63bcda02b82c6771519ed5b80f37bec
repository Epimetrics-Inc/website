I"Î<p>To ensure good quality care and improved service delivery in the country, health facilities are monitored by the Department of Health (DOH). In compliance with these health facilitiesâ€™ annual licensing, DOH requires submission of Hospital Statistical Reports (HSRs), which are reports on quality management, hospital operations, staffing patterns, and finances. This study assessed the online Hospital Statistical Reports (OHSR) in terms of health information resources, indicators, data management, and information products.</p>

<p>The study revealed that there is a need for quality improvement efforts in data collection and validation of the OHSRs. Quality of data from OHSRs were compromised because of problems in both the hospital side and the regulator side. First, there were variations in hospital processes â€“ such as how work was being done, who does the work, and the type of indicators used. Second, there were policy gaps from the regulator â€“ such as the lack of a feedback mechanism and unclear implementing rules and regulations. Poor quality data from OHSRs resulted in the limitations of the study in terms of generalizability and accuracy. Because informed policy making rests on the analysis of quality data, the study recommends that quality improvement efforts of the OHSR process be undertaken. These will provide sufficient data for the monitoring of health facilities and allow regulators to ensure good quality care and improve service delivery.</p>
