I"<p>Four screening interventions for colorectal cancer (CRC), namely Guaiac-Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), f​lexible sigmoidoscopy (FS)​, and colonoscopy​ were evaluated with a cost-utility analysis and budget impact analysis. Results revealed that all screening modalities were very cost-effective compared to no screening considering the incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs) fall below the 1 GDP per capita threshold of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The cheapest interventions (gFOBT or FIT, followed by colonoscopy) have a budget impact of Php9B in the first year assuming moderate compliance but the budget can fall as low as Php1B for the first year assuming low compliance.
Thus, PhilHealth may introduce a benefit package for outpatient screening of colorectal cancer covering either gFOBT or FIT, both followed by colonoscopy every 10 years. Further criteria should be considered, such as effectiveness, safety, availability and consensus among clinicians. Moreover, this recommendation must be accompanied by (1) the establishment of a standardized system and registry to have a better picture of local cancer incidence and prevalence, as well as (2) the inclusion of prescribed CRC Drugs in the Philippine National Formulary (PNF).</p>
