I"™<p>Essential medicines that meet the health needs of the population should be available and accessible at all times, in the appropriate dosage forms, and at prices affordable to all. However, in the Philippines, medicine purchase continues to make up a big chunk of out-of-pocket expenditures, especially among the poorest quintile, and drug procurement remains to be a problem. This project looked into factors influencing drug prices among Philippine public hospitals that can aid decision-makers in minimizing these inter-hospital variation in drug prices.</p>

<p>Results of the study revealed a spectrum of factors influencing hospital mark-ups, including hospital level, distance from the population center, compliance with procurement guidelines set out by WHO, expertise of human resources with regards to procurement planning, adherence to the generics law, availability of indicator drugs, and distribution issues from the warehouse and pharmacy. When analyzed further, it was found that recommendations directed to the three main policies that affect the Drug Management Cycle may address these factors.</p>

<p>First, the Drug Price Reference Index (DPRI) should be tailored to the location (e.g, having a regional DPRI) and hospital category in order to allow for flexibility in the procurement process and decrease failed biddings. Second, a stricter implementation of R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA) must be enforced given that as much as 30% of hospitals only use past consumption for procurement planning, disregarding other useful indicators for proper forecasting. GPRA guidelines must be reviewed and revised to include measures that will prevent supplier collusion and to explore alternative modes of procurement other than public bidding. Lastly, the Generics Law should include provisions to incentivize generic drug procurement, as there are still hospitals that procure 100% branded drugs.</p>
